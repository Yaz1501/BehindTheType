Netflix is a very recognisable platform, where members can watch TV shows and movies instantly in over 190 countries. The company was established in august 1997 in the United States. Throughout the years the typography used by the company has changed, in fact, as the audience was changing, the typography was modified accordingly.

The original logo was designed as block letters, all capitals on a red background. It might seem very simple, but there are other elements added that makes this typography so effective. The letters were arched to look like the curve of an old projector. This was implemented by the black shadowing behind the white letters. The combination between these elements made the Netflix title look like a projected movie on a screen. The red background was a brilliant choice of colour, it was the same deep red as theatre curtains, the type of curtains they used at old movies screenings, musicals, plays, it is also the same red they use for red carpets.
